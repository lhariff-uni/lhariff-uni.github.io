### Static website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) framework
# INCOMPLETE AND ARCHIVED

Originally going to be a portfolio website to showcase various projects created during university.
**However**, the execution and style of the website ended up not suiting its purpose. This was realised after a lot of the website had been built, thus, instead of being revised, this project was scrapped to be revisited with a more modern framework and more planning beforehand to best showcase a portfolio.

## CSS Frameworks
- __[Materialize](https://materializecss.com/):__ Chosen due to experience prototyping following Google's Material Design framework. This was a simple framework to use, and I expected it was all I would have needed to complete this website (as I did not intend it to be complicated but rather be simple for the user). It worked. However, proceeding with more experience, I rather focus on the more well-known frameworks that is more expectedly maintained.
- __[Animate](https://animate.style/):__ A simple CSS framework to add small interest to the website.
